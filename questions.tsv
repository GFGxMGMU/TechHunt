Polymorphism is the technique of encapsulating data and methods within a class to protect the internal state of the object and prevent unauthorized access from outside code.	Polymorphism describes the ability of a function to change its behavior based on the number and type of parameters passed to it, enabling flexible function definitions.	4	3

17	In a relational database, what is the purpose of a primary key?	A primary key is used to define the data type of a table and ensure that each record in the table is stored in sequential order based on the primary key values.	A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table, ensuring that no two rows have the same primary key value, and it cannot contain NULL values.	A primary key is a special key that is used to group records together in a table, often used for sorting and filtering data efficiently.	A primary key is an optional field in a table that can be used to create a relationship between two or more tables in the database.	2	4

2	A Caesar Cipher is an encryption technique that was famously used by, you guessed it right, Julius Caesar! In this technique, you shift the input characters 3 places forward.
