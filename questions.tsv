18	In object-oriented programming, what is the concept of polymorphism?	Polymorphism is the process by which a class (the child or subclass) acquires attributes and behaviors from another class (the parent or superclass), allowing for code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships between classes.	Polymorphism is the process by which a single class can inherit properties and behaviors from multiple parent classes, combining the functionality of all the parent classes into one.	Polymorphism is the technique of encapsulating data and methods within a class to protect the internal state of the object and prevent unauthorized access from outside code.	Polymorphism describes the ability of a function to change its behavior based on the number and type of parameters passed to it, enabling flexible function definitions.	4	3

17	In a relational database, what is the purpose of a primary key?	A primary key is used to define the data type of a table and ensure that each record in the table is stored in sequential order based on the primary key values.	A primary key uniquely identifies each record in a table, ensuring that no two rows have the same primary key value, and it cannot contain NULL values.	A primary key is a special key that is used to group records together in a table, often used for sorting and filtering data efficiently.	A primary key is an optional field in a table that can be used to create a relationship between two or more tables in the database.	2	4

6	A Caesar Cipher is an encryption technique that was famously used by, you guessed it right, Julius Caesar! In this technique, you shift the input characters 3 places forward. "A" becomes "D" ("A"->"B"->"C"->"D"), "G" becomes "J" ("G"->"H"->"I"->"J") and "Z" becomes "C" ("Z"->"A"->"B"->"C") due to rotation. Thus, "TECH" would become "WHFK KXQW".

11	Given two numbers `L` and `R`, your friend Chhakuli wants the maximum amount of numbers in ascending order she can fit into the given range (L and R inclusive) such that each number is bigger than the previous one and the difference of any two numbers is also greater than the difference of the previous two numbers. In short, the numbers keep on increasing and so does the difference between them, For example, the correct answer for `L=1` and `R=5` would be 3 (one of the set could be the numbers {1, 2, 5}). Chhakuli gives you `L=124` and `R=291`.	34	23	17	28	3	5
12	We all love Ganeshotsav! Gotya is organising a *limbu-chamcha* competitions. It so happened that Gotya got a generous funding from the CSE department of JNEC and thus was able to award a prize money of 5K to anyone who finished the race, irrespective of their finishing place. Bad move! Gotya got more registrations than the number of hair strands on his head. Gotya was really smart though. He devised a 2D race where he could accomodate many more players.\n\nIn Gotya's race, there is a 6X6 grid with sides A, B, C and D, in anticlockwise order. 6 contestants start from the side A and 6 from the side B (from behind the squares, not on them yet). The ones who start at A must reach C to complete the race and the ones who start at B, should reach D. Gotya records their speeds (in squares per second; if the speed is 2, then the contestant moves 2 squares every second and reaches the finish line after 4 seconds; if the speed is 1, 7 seconds are required to reach the finish line) and they are in anticlockwise order: {2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2} for contestants at A and {1, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1} for B. If two contestants each from A and B are at the same square at the same time, they collide and are **immediately** out of the race. Note: collisions only occur if two contestants are at the same square at unit time and **not in any other case**. Find the number of contestants who make it to the end. Here's a diagram to make it easy for you to understand:	5	6	7	8	2	5
13	Black Widow and Hawkeye are on Vormir to get the Soul Stone. All of us know what happens next. This isn't that version of reality. Here, Dr Strange (in all his wisdom of infinity and probability) warns them that one of them is going to die. But, it can be prevented. They just have to play a little game on Vormir. If the ground 300 metres below is hit with a stone at a velocity `v` at the time of contact, it bounces the stone back up at a velocity `0.7v`. The stone can then bounce up any number of times on the ground, its velocity upon every subsequent bounce becoming 70% of its previous velocity. The stone will stop bouncing if the speed with which it hits the ground is less than 20 m/s. If the duo are able to make the stone bounce 7 times (the stone hitting the ground but not bouncing back up doesn't count) the normal stone will turn into the Soul Stone! They can even celebrate on the planet for some time with the local delicacy of Vormkarpale!\nBut,  but,  but,  but,  butttttt, if they fail, both of them die!! So tread carefully.\nYou have to determine the minimum velocity with which they have to throw the stone to get the Soul Stone back and heave a sigh of relief. Assume the gravity on Vormir is 5m/s<sup>2</sup> and there is negligible atmosphere	205m/s	101m/s	161m/s	229m/s	3	5
